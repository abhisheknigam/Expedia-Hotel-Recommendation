Execution Steps for decision tree algo:
1. Download and extract the train dataset. It will be extracted as train.csv
2. Run python expedia_decision_tree.py to run the algorithm
3. If you have to run on a dataset with smaller rows. Please changed line #164 to reflect the proper file name and run the algorithm using command given in 2.
